(ns tilemap-parity-test
  "Parity gate between `src/tilemap.kotoba` (the semantic authority) and
  `src/tilemap.cljc` (the load path a Clojure/ClojureScript consumer requires).

  Shape follows `kotoba-lang/css` (`css.kotoba-parity-test`), `kotoba-lang/dsl-core`
  and `kotoba-lang/async` (ADR-2608130900), and `kotoba-lang/postfx` (ADR-2608133600):
  the `.kotoba` is compiled here and executed through the KIR interpreter in this same
  JVM, so nothing crosses a runtime boundary, and `kotoba-lang/compiler` stays a
  test-only dependency.

  WHY THE .cljc EXISTS AT ALL. `2ce204c3` (2026-07-20) deleted `src/tilemap.cljc` and
  put the `.kotoba` at that path. A `.kotoba` is on no Clojure classpath, so `tilemap`
  stopped being loadable by every runtime this workspace ranks above the native path.

  SEMANTICS DECISION: BEHAVIOUR RESTORED VERBATIM, VALIDATION TAKEN FROM THE GUEST.
  The restored file is `2ce204c3^` unchanged except that `tile-layer` and `tilemap`
  now fail closed on non-positive dimensions, because the guest traps there and
  ADR-2608130900 set that precedent in `async` (the guest's `chan` validated where the
  original did not; the restored `.cljc` adopted the validation). Nothing else was
  changed — in particular the storage was NOT changed, for the reason in divergence 1.

  PARITY IS ASSERTED OVER BEHAVIOUR, NOT OVER STATE. `layer-get`, `tile-empty?`,
  `tile-solid?`, `solid?`, `world-to-tile`, `tile-to-world` and the *contents* of
  `layer-to-instances` are compared cell by cell and call by call after identical
  edit sequences. The layer documents themselves are not compared, because:

  DIVERGENCE 1 — THE GUEST STORES TILES SPARSELY AND THIS NAMESPACE STORES THEM
  DENSELY, AND THAT IS FORCED. A KIR document container holds at most 32 items, so a
  dense `w*h` tile vector is impossible in the guest for any layer bigger than a 5x6:
  the repo's own `tilemap-test` builds a 10x10 layer, which would need 100. The guest
  therefore keeps `:tiles` as a vector of `{:x :y :tile}` entries for occupied cells
  only. This namespace keeps the dense vector the pre-migration contract published.
  Rewriting this namespace to the sparse shape would change its public value for no
  reason — it has no 32-item budget — so the shapes are stated to differ and the
  comparison is made at the boundary where both can answer.

  DIVERGENCE 2 — `layer-to-instances` EMITS A DIFFERENT ORDER. This namespace walks
  the dense grid row-major, so instances come out sorted by (y, x). The guest walks
  its sparse entry list, so instances come out in the order the tiles were SET. The
  two agree exactly when tiles are set row-major and diverge otherwise; both cases are
  asserted below.

  DIVERGENCE 3 — THE GUEST CANNOT HOLD A 33RD OCCUPIED TILE. Same 32-item budget.
  This is the `async` shape and not the `postfx` shape: 33 occupied tiles is not an
  exotic edge for a tilemap, it is a small room, so the bound is a real narrowing of
  the contract rather than a theoretical one. Asserted, not hidden.

  `empty-tile` is a `def` here and a nullary export in the guest, because Kotoba has
  no top-level value bindings; the value is compared, the binding form is not. `main`
  is a wasm entry point and is not mirrored."
